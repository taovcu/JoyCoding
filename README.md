# JoyCoding

Developer: Tao Lu, PhD

This is a repository created to make kids solve mathematical problem in fun ways.

I plan to design math problems based on Common Core State Standards for Mathematics. The document is available at [CCSS Mathematics](http://www.k12.wa.us/CoreStandards/Mathematics/pubdocs/CCSSI_MathStandards.pdf)

You are welcomed to use and contribute to this project.
