# Joyful Math Tests for Kids

This project aims to enable kids solve mathematical problems in fun ways.

The developers plan to design math problems based on Common Core State Standards for Mathematics. The document is available at [CCSS Mathematics](http://www.k12.wa.us/CoreStandards/Mathematics/pubdocs/CCSSI_MathStandards.pdf).

Parents and students are welcomed to use materials in this project.
